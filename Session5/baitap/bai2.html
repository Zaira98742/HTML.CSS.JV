        <p><i><abbr title="info">Taylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Known
                    for her autobiographical songwriting, artistic reinventions, and cultural impact, Swift is a leading
                    figure in popular music and the subject of widespread media coverage, with a vast fanbase known as
                    Swifties. <br>Swift signed to Big Machine Records in 2005, debuting as a country singer with the
                    albums Taylor Swift (2006) and Fearless (2008). The singles "Teardrops on My Guitar", "Love Story",
                    and "You Belong with Me" 1 found crossover success on country and pop radio formats. She
                    incorporated rock on Speak Now (2010) and electronic on Red (2012), later re-calibrating her image
                    from country to pop with the synth-pop set 1989 (2014); the ensuing media scrutiny inspired the
                    hip-hop-imbued Reputation (2017). The albums contained the Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles "We
                    Are Never Ever Getting Back Together", "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", "Bad Blood" and "Look What You
                    Made Me 2 Do".</abbr></i></p>
